This is a Burger Builder App!

In this project I used create-react app, Redux as my store store, Firebase for backend, React-router for routing, and axios for http requests.

Demo of the project: https://react-my-burger-69c9b.web.app/

To run the project in development mode download the project to your PC, open the project, and run 'npm install' in command line. 
After the process is finished run 'npm start' to start a development server.
