This is a Burger Builder App I have created during a course React - The Complete Guide on Udemy.com.

Demo of the project: https://react-my-burger-69c9b.web.app/

To run the project in development mode download the project to your PC, open the project, and run 'npm install' in command line. After the process is finished run 'npm start' to start a development server.
